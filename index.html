                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>If you're here, you probably already know who I am. After years of collecting VHS tapes of any kind of movie under the sun,
                I, Aiden "Tapehead" Martin, have become the most popular person on the entire internet. You're here to compete with me, aren't you?
                Well, I wish you the best of luck, because I would genuinely be surprised if your collection even matches up to mine.</p>

                <h1>What is this site for?</h1>
                <p>After winning the "Internet's Coolest Man" Award in 2019, my VHS collecting habits seemed to spread worldwide. Despite
                the fact that everyone and their grandma seems to have jumped on this trend after I did, it seems that no one has even come
                close to the utter coolness that my collection has to offer. If you think you're up to the challenge, go ahead and scroll through
                the 3 pages and select which tapes you own. Take a screenshot and send it to me at 555-867-5309. I'll judge your coolness and if I
                think you're up to snuff, I'll come to your house and inspect your entire collection personally. If, by some incredible means, I feel
                that your collection is cooler than mine, I'll relinquish my crown as the internet's coolest man, and you will burn me at the stake
                as is the law in this current year. Best of luck!</p>
